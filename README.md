# Project Euler Solutions
A collection of mostly working solutions to the first few Project Euler problemsm, created as an intellectual exercise and for learning  purposes. Some of the solutions are dependent on source files, which have been included. The structure of the code is still a work in progress, with unit-testing capabilities to be implemented for the Java files.

The full set of Project Euler problems can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
